In this task we will look into how we may need to optimize some SQL statements to be much faster.

## Guidance

1. Start this project in [Github Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces)[^1]
2. Start the SQL Server with `docker compose up`
3. Start the dotnet project with `SEED=true dotnet run`[^2]
4. Read [the story](STORY.md)
5. Read the [notes](NOTES.md)

## Additional task

* Improve the performance

## Notes
