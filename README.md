# Trees of Data

In this task we will look into how we may need to optimize some SQL statements to be much faster.

## Guidance

1. Start this project in [Github Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces)[^1]
2. Start the db and app `docker compose up`[^2]
3. Open the app/swagger *(a popup will appear, you need to add `swagger/index.html` to the url)*
> Note: seeding may need some time to complete
4. Read [the story](STORY.md)
5. Read the [notes](NOTES.md)
